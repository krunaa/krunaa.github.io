      <description>Intro Forever alone forever at home. I have unfortunately made so many good friends after ending up at the cemetery. Each friend deeply burried under the frozen earth. I have never had so many friends talk back to me while my head was laying on the cold ground. It was absolutely amazing.
I talked and they talked back, I reached and they reached back, pulling me into their cold and broken embrace.</description>
